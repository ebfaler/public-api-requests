# Public API Requests # 
 
 Unit 5 Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

I have built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup. Employees are remote and so the app allows them to share contact information with one another.

I have used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,”. A JSON object is reqeusted from the API and data is parsed so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
